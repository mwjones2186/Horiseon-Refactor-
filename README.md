# Code Refactor Starter Code

This project was designed to debug and de-clutter a pre existing code. 

First, I started with the HTML. Looked over formatting, created some spacing to separate out some code. Then I added some comments for my reference. 

Secondly, I did the same with the CSS page. The CSS doc had code spattered around and so I sectioned it off based on layout of page. I then began to reorganize and eliminate clutter and see if there were any duplicate codes or code structures I could consolodate. 

Then I went to the website and started clicking on everything to better understand the functionality of the website. Are any links broken? Are there font issues? What does my code have that the picture does not? 

I found that the SEOptimization navigation button did not take you to the SEO section of the website. 

I also noted the picture of the proper website did not have a footer note. 

Initially I did not like how the wording would line up with the pictures but identified it as a web browser pixel issue and not so much a website issue. I am aware that it is likely a fixable issue, however, im not sure how to do this.
